1|Good evening, miss! How are you feeling right now? Are you still feeling ill?|L
0|1. (Wealthy) Why, yes! And I'll pay you double if you can help me quickly!##2. (Privileged) I could go to any hospital in town, but I heard you were the best doctor in town.##3. I don't have a choice. I need your help!|C
0|You know what it's like, doctor. Someone like me can't just walk into any hospital they want.##I had to go very far just to get here.|L
1|I see. How do you feel about that? |L
0|1. (Resigned) It won't change, doc. Not in our lives.##2. (Revolutionary) It's wrong, doctor Jones, and it needs to change.##3. ...|C
1|I see.|L
1|Let's go back to your condition. How are you feeling?|L
0|1. (Correctly Diagnosed) I have cancer, doctor Jones. I don't feel good at all.##2. (Concerned) I'm under a lot of pressure. Work, family, it's very stressful.##3. I think I might be... expecting again, doctor.|C
1|Is that so?|L
0|Yes, but it feels a bit... different this time.|L
1|Hm. In any case, we'll have to take a sample and send it off for analysis. With any luck, the rabbit will be dead.|L
0|Excuse me?|L
1|Oh, don't worry your little head about it, miss. It's a medical term.|L
0|...Oh.|L
1|So, how many sexual partners have you had in the last month?|L
0|1. (Offended) What's that supposed to mean?##2. (Personal) I don't see how that has anything to do with this.##3. Just my husband, doctor. Why do you ask?|C
1|Oh, nothing personal. If this is caused by a disease, and not pregnancy, then it's in everyone's best interest to find out what it is. It's standard procedure.|L
0|I understand.|L
1|Either way, we'll have to take some samples and run all the tests. We should have the results within a month.|L
1|I'll contact you as soon as they're finished, miss Lacks.|L
2|Thank you, doctor Jones. I look forward to it.|L
1|Amazing. Her cells keep reproducing outside her body. This is a discovery of vast scientific importance.|L
1|What should I do?|L
1|1. (Passive) I have to tell mrs. Lacks. The decision should be hers.##2. (Compassionate) Her life is forfeit, but her condition should be known. I have to tell her family.##3. (Secretive) I have to analyze this further. To the laboratory.|C
